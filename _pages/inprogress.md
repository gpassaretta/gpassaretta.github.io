To what extent is social inequality in school-age achievement determined before and during schooling? (with J Skopek and T van Huizen) – [_working paper_](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yqt6n/)

We estimate the degree to which socioeconomic status (SES) gaps in children’s language skills observed in primary schooling are already determined before children enter school in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. We use representative and longitudinal cohort data and apply instrumental variable estimation to deal with measurement error in test scores. Around 60–80 per cent of SES gaps in language at the end of primary school are attributable to gaps settled before formal schooling, while at most 20–40 per cent is attributable to SES operating during the school years. We also show that ignoring measurement error results in a major overestimation of the role of SES during schooling. Our findings suggest that the most effective strategy for reducing social inequality in school-age achievement is reducing inequality before school life starts.

Inequality at the top. The gender wage gap among the Italian educational elites (with M Triventi) – [_working paper_](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/updgw/)

<summary>Read more</summary>
Women notoriously get lower wages compared to men. Does a gender wage gap exist also at the top of the educational distribution? Based on population data on two recent cohort of PhD graduates in Italy, we found women’s monthly wages are on average 16% lower than men’s’ after 5–6 years on the labor market. The gender wage gap is even stronger at the very bottom and the top of the wage distribution, around 22% and 19% respectively. Educational pathways before and during PhD studies, occupational characteristics, and the family situation explain almost half of the average women’s penalty and working hours alone one-fifth of it. However, the strongest penalties at the bottom and the top of the wage distribution remain largely unexplained.

Socioeconomic disparities in early language development in two Norwegian samples (with L Ribeiro, HD Zachrisson, A Nærde and M Wang) – _on request_

Socioeconomic disparities in early language development are commonly observed, and may have lasting effects perpetuating social disadvantage. The aim of this study is to investigate when social gaps in language problems arise, how they develop across early childhood, and how they change across the first years of schooling. We address this question in two large longitudinal Norwegian datasets: the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS) and the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Despite some slight differences across the two samples, we found that children from higher social background are less likely to have language difficulties starting from age 18 months and throughout their early childhood up to age 8 (grade 2). Moreover, while early language problems are strongly predictive of later problems, maternal education made an additional contribution to explaining language difficulties measured by one of our latent language outcomes at the beginning of school life. This social inequality in language development arises early, even in a country like Norway, a wealthy social democracy with low unemployment and one of the most egalitarian countries in Europe.
