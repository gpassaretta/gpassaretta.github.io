Women notoriously get lower wages compared to men. Does a gender wage gap exist also at the top of the educational distribution? Based on population data on two recent cohort of PhD graduates in Italy, we found women’s monthly wages are on average 16% lower than men’s’ after 5–6 years on the labor market. The gender wage gap is even stronger at the very bottom and the top of the wage distribution, around 22% and 19% respectively. Educational pathways before and during PhD studies, occupational characteristics, and the family situation explain almost half of the average women’s penalty and working hours alone one-fifth of it. However, the strongest penalties at the bottom and the top of the wage distribution remain largely unexplained.

Do children of immigrants catch up in school? Longitudinal evidence from the UK, the Netherlands and Germany (with T van Huizen and J Skopek) - _on request_

This paper studies the development of language achievement of children with immigrant parents in comparison to those with native-born parents from preschool to end of primary school. We use longitudinal data from the UK, Germany and the Netherlands and apply instrumental variable estimation to address measurement error in test scores. Our findings show that second-generation migrant children are at significant disadvantage before the start of school but on average catch up during primary schooling.  In all three countries, we found no additional migration penalties over the school years when comparing children with immigrant and native-born parents who had the same language achievement at preschool age. In the UK, significant additional premiums are found and children with foreign-born parents outperform children with native-born parents with comparable language skills in preschool. However, the results show substantial heterogeneity by ethnicity and country of origin. Children with Turkish parents are the only migrant group that does not show any sign of catching up but rather experiences additional penalties in achievement during primary schooling.
