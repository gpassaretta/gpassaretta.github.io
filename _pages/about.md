Previously, he held research positions at _Trinity College Dublin_, _European University Institute_, and _Stockholm University_. He is currently a member of the [Centre for Interdisciplinary Educational Research (CIDER)](https://www.leibniz-bildung.de/en/cider/), the [Comparative Life course & Inequality Research Centre (CLIC)](https://www.eui.eu/Projects/CLIC), and the [Stockholm University Demography Unit (SUDA)](https://www.suda.su.se).

His research focuses on the formation and the evolution of education and labour market inequalities over the life course. Recently, he developed a specific interest in the causal effect of schooling on learning inequality, and in the disparities in labour market attainment of educational elites.  

Passaretta's works have been published in leading academic journals like American Sociological Review, Social Forces, and Population and Development Review, and featured in major press outlets. His recent research on the role of schooling for inequality in learning won the Best Article Award from the Leibniz Institute for Educational Trajectories in Germany (LifBi) and the Italian Society of Economic Sociology (SISEC).
