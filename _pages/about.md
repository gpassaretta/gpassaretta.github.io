======

Giampiero Passaretta is a Research Fellow at the _[European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences)_ and the _[College for Interdisciplinary Educational Research](https://www.leibniz-bildung.de/en/cider/)_. After gaining his PhD from the _University of Trento_, he has worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the _Trinity College Dublin_. He is a member of the [Centre for Social Inequality Studies (CSIS)](https://r.unitn.it/en/soc/csis), the [Comparative Life course & Inequality Research Centre (CLIC)](https://www.eui.eu/Projects/CLIC), and the [Trinity Research in Childhood Centre (TRiCC)](https://www.tcd.ie/tricc/).

His research focuses on the formation and the evolution of education and labour market inequalities over the life course. Recently, he developed a specific interest in the causal effect of schooling on learning inequality, and in the disparities in labour market attainment of educational elites.  


Passaretta's works have been published in academic journals like _American Sociological Review_, _Social Forces_ and _Socio-Economic Review_. His recent research on the evolution of socioeconomic inequality in children's achievement has been featured in major press outlets, like _Die Zeit_.
